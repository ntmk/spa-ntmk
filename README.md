# Old portfolio site - SPA (Single Page Application)

This version of my portfolio was built on from a jekyll template for GitHub pages.

The blog / stories section was connected to the Ghost CMS and used a MySql database.

Implemented Google analytics and other tracking to improve SEO (Search Engine Omptimization) value.
